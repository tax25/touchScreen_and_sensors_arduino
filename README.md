# touchScreen_and_sensors_arduino
This code has been written to control a touch screen and display the values taken from 2 sensors. 
The sensors I used were 2. One for Co2 (MQ135) and one for temperature and humidity (DHT22). 
Most of the code is just frontend coding to make the UI look nice. The actual code to read the sensors and plot the graphs is not that much.
